Step 1. App.js 
- route requests from localhost:3000/recipes to the router/recipes.js ✅ 
- add logger for testing purposes - which takes everything to route ✅

Step 2. recipes.js file 
- CRUD routes
    - Read 2 by ID - GET - DONE ✅
        - route handler recipes with query - DONE ✅
        - for loop to iterate- DONE ✅
            - if statement to match ID with array- DONE ✅
            - assign the responseObject- DONE ✅
            - respond with responseObject- DONE ✅

    - Create - POST - DONE ✅
        - route handler with post query - DONE ✅
        - assign the request to a variable - DONE ✅ 
        - push into array - DONE ✅
        - assign the responseObject- DONE ✅
        - respond with responseObject- DONE ✅ 

    - Update - PUT ✅ 
        - route handler with put  ✅ 
        - assign the request to a variable ✅ 
        - replacing into array ✅ 
            - for loop to match with the ID OR handle a query to find it  ✅ 
                - reassign recipes[i] = updated  ✅ 
        - assign the responseObject ✅ 
        - respond with responseObject ✅ 

    - Delete ✅
        - route handler with put query ✅
        - delete the entry (whatever opposite of array.push() Slice it? )✅ 

- Default (would be after CRUD routes) ✅
    - return recipe array (read 1) ✅ 
        - route handler recipers - done ✅ 
        - return entire array as JSON object (payload)✅ 
        - assign the responseObject - done✅ 

C - create (post)
R - read (get)
U - update (patch and put )
D - delete (delete)

Modularizing data interactions 
1. 
- move logic from getRecipes into models/recipes.js✅ 
    - import into recipes router file✅ 
2. 
- move logic from getRecipeId into models/recipes.js ✅
    - import into recipes router file ✅ 
3. 
- move logic from create recipe into models/recipes.js✅ 
    - import into recipes router file✅ 
4. 
- move logic from update recipte into models/recipes.js✅ 
    - import into recipes router file✅ 
5. 
- move logic from delete recipe into models/recipes.js✅ 
    - import into recipes router file✅
