Step 1. App.js 
- route requests from localhost:3000/recipes to the router/recipes.js
- add logger for testing purposes - which takes everything to route

Step 2. recipes.js file 
- CRUD routes
    - Read 2 by ID - GET
        - route handler recipes with query
        - for loop to iterate
            - if statement to match ID with array
            - assign the responseObject
            - respond with responseObject

    - Create - POST
        - route handler with post query 
        - assign the request to a variable 
        - push into array 
        - assign the responseObject
        - respond with responseObject

    - Update - PUT
        - route handler with put query 
        - assign the request to a variable 
        - replacing into array
            - for loop to match with the ID OR handle a query to find it  
                - reassign recipes[i] = updated 
        - assign the responseObject
        - respond with responseObject

    - Delete 
        - route handler with put query 
        - delete the entry (whatever opposite of array.push() Slice it? ) 

- Default (would be after CRUD routes)
    - return recipe array (read 1)
        - route handler recipers
        - return entire array as JSON object (payload)
        - assign the responseObject

C - create (post)
R - read (get)
